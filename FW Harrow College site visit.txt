Dear Huw

I am writing to invite you to attend a site Visit at Harrow college on Friday 
the 4th of April. The site visit will start at 9.30 am at Harrow Weald campus, 
and the then we will travel to the Harrow on the Hill campus at 10.30 where we 
will spend approx 1 hour there afterwhich we would return to Harrow Weald 
Campus. A mini bus will be provided by the college for travel between both 
sites. Can you confirm who will be attending the site vist.


Regards


Rasheid Shalash
